# WHAT IS  GIT ?

- A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As developers make changes to the project, any earlier version of the project can be recovered at any time.

- Developers can review project history to find out:

 Which changes were made?
 Who made the changes?
When were the changes made?
Why were changes needed?
VCSs give each contributor a unified and consistent view of a project, surfacing work that's already in progress. Seeing a transparent history of changes, who made them, and how they contribute to the development of a project helps team members stay aligned while working independently.

In a distributed version control system, every developer has a full copy of the project and project history. Unlike once popular centralized version control systems, DVCSs don't need a constant connection to a central repository. Git is the most popular distributed version control system. Git is commonly used for both open source and commercial software development, with significant benefits for individuals, teams and businesses.

 # Basic Git commands

 - To use Git, developers use specific commands to copy, create, change, and combine code. These commands can be executed directly from the command line or by using an application like GitHub Desktop. Here are some common commands for using Git:

git init initializes a brand new Git repository and begins tracking an existing directory. It adds a hidden subfolder within the existing directory that houses the internal data structure required for version control.

git clone creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all the project's files, history, and branches.

git add stages a change. Git tracks changes to a developer's codebase, but it's necessary to stage and take a snapshot of the changes to include them in the project's history. This command performs staging, the first part of that two-step process. Any changes that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part of the project's history. Staging and committing separately gives developers complete control over the history of their project without changing how they code and work.

git commit saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process. In short, a commit functions like taking a photo. Anything that's been staged with git add will become a part of the snapshot with git commit.

git status shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.

git branch shows the branches being worked on locally.

git merge merges lines of development together. This command is typically used to combine changes made on two distinct branches. For example, a developer would merge when they want to combine changes from a feature branch into the main branch for deployment.

git pull updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart. Developers use this command if a teammate has made commits to a branch on a remote, and they would like to reflect those changes in their local environment.

git push updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.


# GITHUB 

  
- At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. To understand exactly what GitHub is, you need to know two connected principles:

Version control
Git
In this article, we’ll first explain those two principles. Then, we’ll dig into more about GitHub and how you can actually use GitHub to work with WordPress and/or Kinsta.

# How does GitHub work?

- Users of GitHub create accounts, upload files, and start coding projects. However, the true work of GitHub occurs when people begin to cooperate. There are many challenges to creating collaborative projects with distributed teams. GitHub makes this process much simpler in a few different ways.

For instance, all of the code and documentation is in one location. This reduces access concerns for everyone who wants to contribute to a project. Each repository also includes instructions and other information to assist define project goals and guidelines.

Assume two developers are working on independent pieces of code. These two lines of code should be compatible. However, occasionally one piece of code might cause the other to fail. Or a piece of code may have an unexpected effect on how the other code operates.

GitHub overcomes these issues by showing how both files will affect the main branch. It detects these problems before pushing changes, which significantly improves the coding process.

# Finance 
- GitHub was a bootstrapped start-up business, which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded solely by its three founders and start taking on employees.[24]

In July 2012, four years after the company was founded, Andreessen Horowitz invested $100 million in venture capital[8] with a $750 million valuation.[25]

In July 2015 GitHub raised another $250 million (~$314 million in 2023) of venture capital in a series B round. The lead investor was Sequoia Capital, and other investors were Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, IVP (Institutional Venture Partners) and other venture capital funds.[26][27] The company was then valued at approximately $2 billion.[28]

As of 2023, GitHub was estimated to generate $1 billion in revenue annually.

# History

 - On February 24, 2009, GitHub announced that within the first year of being online, GitHub had accumulated over 46,000 public repositories, 17,000 of which were formed in the previous month. At that time, about 6,200 repositories had been forked at least once, and 4,600 had been merged.

That same year, the site was used by over 100,000 users, according to GitHub,[30] and had grown to host 90,000 unique public repositories, 12,000 having been forked at least once, for a total of 135,000 repositories.[31]

In 2010, GitHub was hosting 1 million repositories.[32] A year later, this number doubled.[33] ReadWriteWeb reported that GitHub had surpassed SourceForge and Google Code in total number of commits for the period of January to May 2011.[34] On January 16, 2013, GitHub passed the 3 million users mark and was then hosting more than 5 million repositories.[35] By the end of the year, the number of repositories was twice as great, reaching 10 million repositories.[36]

In 2015, GitHub opened an office in Japan, its first outside of the U.S.[37]

On February 28, 2018, GitHub fell victim to the third-largest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history, with incoming traffic reaching a peak of about 1.35 terabits per second.[38]

On June 19, 2018, GitHub expanded its GitHub Education by offering free education bundles to all schools.[39][40]
